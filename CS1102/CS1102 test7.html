                <li>Representing it in an effective way</li>
            </ol>
                Our project explores the key factors influencing car prices using the dataset <code>CarPrice_Assignment.csv</code>. 
                We focused on five critical factors: horsepower, curb weight, engine size, car dimensions, and fuel efficiency. 
                The findings aim to assist sellers, consumers, and developers of predictive models in understanding car pricing dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used two chatbots for accuracy (<strong>Chat-4o-128k</strong> and <strong>Claude-3.5-Sonnet-200k</strong>) and focused on 
                <strong>horsepower</strong>, <strong>curb weight</strong>, <strong>engine size</strong>, <strong>width/length dimensions</strong>, 
                and <strong>fuel efficiency</strong> because these variables were analyzed and emphasized by both chatbots.

                    <h2>Explorating on AI Application</h2>
                    <p>During the analysis process, we found that using different strategies is helping AI to give insight more explicity</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Polite Prompting Tech</strong></li>
                            <p>We found that using polite speech to prompt Ai may derive more detailed insight more than directly give command prompting tech.<br />
                            Initially, two new chats were started. In one chat, Artificial Intelligence was politely asked to explain the document's content. In the other chat, a request was made for a summary of the information. The outcomes differed; polite inquiries yielded more detailed responses from the AI. This phenomenon suggests that polite prompting encourages the AI to consider all information in the document, minimizing the risk of overlooking details. In contrast, when commands are direct, the AI responds narrowly, providing only the requested information without elaboration.It's just like when You ask one plus one Artificial intelligence will answer it equals two,but It won't tell you what plus means and why it works.</p>

                            Talk about giving potential context, the AI was tasked with analyzing which cars are most cost-effective at various price points. It provided several options, but the analysis assumed a scenario in which Japanese cars had lost popularity, affecting the choices available. This indicates that results can vary significantly based on contextual factors.</li>

                            In terms of Emphasizing the importance, the AI was requested to categorize features and summarize them into several conditions to explore their relationships. This approach could be beneficial for developers and researchers in setting competitive pricing strategies.</li>
